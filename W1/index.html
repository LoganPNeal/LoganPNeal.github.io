   <h1> Guinness Stew </h1>
    <p>A warm, hearty stew perfect for a chilly day. Tasting many different Gunness stews in Ireland and trying a few different recipes at home, I have created this simple yet delicious recipe.</p>    
<h2>Ingredients:</h2>
<ul>
<li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
<li>3 pounds chuck beef roast</li>
<li>1 ½  large white onion</li>
<li>4 celery stalks</li>
<li>3 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
<li>22 ounces Guinness extra stout(2 bottles) </li>
<li>4 cups chicken broth</li>
<li>4 large carrots</li>
<li>1 pound potatoes</li>
<li>3 teaspoons dried thyme</li>
<li>6 sprigs fresh of parsley </li>
<li>Salt </li>
<li>Pepper</li>
<li>Flour</li>
</ul>    
<h2>Directions:</h2>
<ol>       
<li>If not already, cut the beef into 2-inch pieces. Chop the celery, onion, carrots, and potatoes.</li> 
<li>Melt butter over medium-high heat, add the beef, and brown on all sides. Season with salt and pepper. Add about two handfuls of flour while beef is browning to thicken the stew. Then transfer the beef to crockpot.</li> 
<li>In the same pan, saute the onions and celery on medium-high heat until they start to brown on the edges. Add the tomato paste and season with salt and pepper while mixing well for a few minutes then transfer to crockpot.</li> 
<li>Pour half a bottle of Guinness extra stout in the pan and scrape the bottom and sides to get all the stuck on flavor, pour into crockpot.</li>
<li>Add the rest of your Guinness (1 and ½ bottle), chicken broth, potatoes, carrots, and thyme to the crockpot.</li> 
<li>Cover and cook on high for 4-5 hours. Taste the stew about 2 hours in, add salt if needed, or flour to thicken more. Serve with fresh chopped parsley and enjoy! </li>
